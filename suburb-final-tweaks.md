# Final Refinements for Suburb Pages

These are not blockers, but they will make the system more robust at scale.

## 1. Trim Advanced Service Mentions Even Further

This line still pushes slightly too far:

> "bespoke business software, SaaS development, tailored web applications"

It is not wrong, but it is unnecessary for a suburb page.

**Better approach:**
- Mention web design and ongoing support only
- Push anything advanced to the town or service page

**Prompt tweak:**
> On suburb pages, avoid listing advanced or specialist services. Refer to the main town page for full capability details.

This reduces duplication across hundreds of suburb pages.

## 2. Reduce Keyword Density Slightly

You are still very safe, but once this scales:
- Hundreds of pages
- Same structure
- Same phrases

**I would explicitly instruct:**
- Use the suburb name naturally
- Avoid repeating it in every sentence

**Prompt tweak:**
> Do not repeat the suburb name excessively. Use natural variation and pronouns once location relevance is established.

This helps avoid footprint patterns.

## 3. Standardise Suburb Page Length

This page is a good length. I would enforce it.

**Recommended rule:**
- **500-750 words** hard cap
- Fewer sections than town pages
- No testimonials by default

**Prompt rule:**
> Suburb pages must be shorter and structurally simpler than main town pages.

## 4. Optional: Nearby Areas Section (Map Pack Support)

If you want to go one level deeper for agencies:

Add a small optional section like:
- "Nearby areas we also support"
- "Close to [Town] town centre"
- "Serving surrounding suburbs"

This reinforces proximity signals without creating new pages.

**Only include if you can keep it factual and light.**
