# Suggested Suburb Page Scorecard

A practical scoring framework that aligns with what you are already doing.

## 1. Content Length (Lower is Better)

**Instead of:** "could be longer"

**Use:**
- Ideal range: **400-650 words**
- Penalty if too long
- Soft warning if under 300

**Thresholds:**
- 300-700 words = 🟢 Green
- Under 300 = 🟡 Amber
- Over 800 = 🔴 Red

This stops bloat.

## 2. Keyword Frequency (Cap It)

**Instead of:** aim for 3-6

**Use:**
- Max 4 to 6
- Penalty above 6
- Warning below 2

This prevents over-optimisation.

## 3. Location Frequency (Much Tighter)

**Instead of:** aim for 4-8

**Use:**
- Ideal: **3-6**
- Penalty above 8

Suburb pages do not need constant repetition once relevance is established.

## 4. Keyword in Title and First Paragraph

Keep both, but soften the language check.

**Check for:**
- Title must imply availability or coverage
- First paragraph must confirm service availability

**Not:**
- "best", "leading", "top", etc

You can score this by checking phrase patterns, not just presence.

## 5. Heading Usage (Limit It)

**Instead of:** reward multiple keyword headings

**Use:**
- Maximum **1 keyword heading**
- Zero penalty if there are none
- Penalty if there are more than 1

This is a big footprint reducer.

## 6. Parent Page Linkage (New Signal)

This should be suburb-specific and weighted highly.

**Checks:**
- Exactly one link to parent town page
- Anchor text is natural, not exact match
- Appears in context, not a CTA block

This should be a green tick requirement.

## 7. Sales Pressure Detection (Negative Score)

This is where GeoScale can really differentiate.

Apply penalties if the suburb page contains:
- Pricing language
- Testimonials
- Feature lists
- Aggressive CTAs
- "best", "award-winning", "leading" language

You can do this with simple keyword detection.

## Example Suburb Score Breakdown

You might show something like:

**Support Score: 88 / 100**

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Content length | Ideal for suburb support |
| Keyword usage | Safe |
| Location usage | Safe |
| Parent page linked | Yes |
| Sales language | Low |
| Over-optimisation risk | Low |

This reframes success for the user.

## UX Benefit for Agencies

This is important commercially.

When agencies see:

Parent page score: optimise harder

Suburb page score: optimise carefully

They immediately understand:

why the pages are different

why GeoScale is not just another bulk page generator

This becomes a selling point, not just an internal mechanic.

## Strong Recommendation

I would:

Rename the suburb score to something like

"Local Support Score"

"Map Pack Support Score"

Visually soften it compared to the parent score

Add tooltips explaining why "lower density" is good here

That protects users from themselves and protects their sites from footprint issues.
