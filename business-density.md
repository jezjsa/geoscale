For what your users are actually trying to do, exact counts are not required. What they need is directional signal, not census data.

Why “less than 20 businesses” is enough

Your users are asking:

Where is demand?

Which suburbs are worth creating pages for?

Where am I weak but there are competitors?

They are not asking:

Is it exactly 37 vs 42 businesses?

So indicating:

Low competition / low presence

Some competition

Busy / saturated

is more than sufficient to drive action.

How I would frame it in GeoScale

Instead of trying to fight the Google cap, lean into it and make it explicit.

Example labels

Low business density (0–5 businesses found)

Medium business density (6–20 businesses found)

High business density (20+ businesses found)

With a small footnote:

Business density is based on Google Maps results and capped per area.

This feels intentional, not like a limitation.

Why this actually improves UX

Removes false precision.

Encourages users to think in priority tiers, not numbers.

Matches how SEOs already think about local areas.

Avoids support tickets later like “why does this say 20 when I know there are more”.

How it helps content strategy directly

For landing page targeting, this is perfect:

Low density + NR
→ Easy win. Create page first.

Medium density + 7–10 ranking
→ Strong opportunity. Create page with testimonials + FAQs.

High density + NR or 11–20
→ Competitive. Worth doing, but needs stronger content and links.

That maps beautifully to your auto-suggested locations feature.

One small UX improvement I’d suggest

Add a tooltip or info icon near “Businesses nearby”:

We show relative business density, not total counts.
Google Maps limits results per area, but this still highlights where demand exists.

That one line will pre-empt 90 percent of objections.
